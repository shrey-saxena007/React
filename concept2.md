React Hooks let developers use state, side effects, and other React features without writing class components. Hooks streamline code, improve readability, and promote a functional programming style, making functional components as powerful

### Types of React Hooks

1. State Hooks-: State hooks, specifically useState and useReducer, allow functional components to manage state in a more efficient and modular way. They provide an easier and cleaner approach to managing component-level states in comparison to class components.
2. Context Hooks-: The useContext hook in React is a powerful and convenient way to consume values from the React Context API in functional components. It allows functional components to access context values directly, without the need to manually pass props down through the component tree
3. Effect Hooks-:Effect hooks, specifically useEffect,useLayoutEffect, and useInsertionEffect, enable functional components to handle side effects in a more efficient and modular way.
4. Performance Hook
5. Resource Hook
6. Other Hooks and Custom Hooks
